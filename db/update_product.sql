-- This sql file will be responsible for updating the description of a product by ID. To update data from a database we use the following syntax: UPDATE Table SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition. Since we are working with the products table we'll change Table to products. Since we are updating the description dynamically we'll set column1 to description and value1 to $2. And since we are updating products by ID we'll set condition to product_id = $1. The order of $1 and $2 doesn't matter as long as you following the same order in the controller file. I personally prefer (id, value) instead of (value, id). The final syntax will look like:
UPDATE products SET description = $2 WHERE product_id = $1;
